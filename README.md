# NN_Custom
hand made neural network without tensorflow or pytorch

## Purpose

This simplified libary is an extended attept to understand the basic FNN network including all the mathematical features implemented in numpy.

## How I approached

I made it a rule not to use any of the public deep learning framworks. I've implemented activation functions, layers, logits. Last but not least, the main logic
for forward propagation and back propagation have also been implemented.

## Future Plans
This Repo has been a nice baseline for the group project in prettydragonov/devdoops
